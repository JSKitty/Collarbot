# Collarbot
A Colla-rs client implementation written in Node as a Discord bot.

## Installation
- Clone the repo.
- `npm i`
- Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json` and customise all parameters.
- Run with `node main`

## Usage

The primary command is the 'zap' command, it's simple: the longer your 'zap' text, the longer the real collar shock. And the more capitals you use (ZAAAP) the stronger the shock.

Examples:
- zap (minimal, hardly noticable)
- zaaaaaaap (longer, but weak)
- ZAAAAAAAP (longer and stronger)
